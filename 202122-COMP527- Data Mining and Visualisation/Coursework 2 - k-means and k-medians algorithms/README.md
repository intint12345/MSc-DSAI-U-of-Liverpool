# Purpose of assessment
The purpose of this assignment is to assess the
understanding of k-means and k-medians
clustering algorithms by implementing the
algorithms and applying them to text
clustering.

# Learning outcome assessed
(1) A critical awareness of current problems
and research issues in data mining.

# Objectives
This assignment requires you to implement the k-means and k-medians clustering algorithms
using the Python programming language.

# NOTE
No credit will be given for implementing any other types of clustering algorithms
or using an existing library for clustering instead of implementing it by yourself.
You are allowed to use
- numpy library for accessing data structures such as numpy.array;
- random module;
- matplotlib for plotting; and
- pandas.read_csv, csv.reader, or similar modules only for reading data from the files.
However, it is not a requirement of the assignment to use any of those libraries.
You must provide a README file describing how to run your code to re-produce your results
